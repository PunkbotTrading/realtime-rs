# Supabase Realtime-rs

Very early development, look away while I wrangle JSON into rust structs.

The plan is to clone the realtime-js client library, keeping the function calls as close to parity as the language allows.

I just googled what an ORM is the other day so I'm sure I got this lol

How hard can it be? /s
